**[Artificer, Sorcerer, Wizard]**

Launch an acid bolt.

# 2. - Annoying Bee (V,S) level 0 Illusion [SOL]

**[Druid, Sorcerer, Wizard]**

The target sees an illusional bee harassing them and has disadvantage on concentration checks until the start of their next turn.

# 3. - *Blade Ward* (V,S) level 0 Abjuration [UB]

**[Bard, Sorcerer, Warlock, Wizard]**

You extend your hand and trace a sigil of warding in the air. Until the end of your next turn, you have resistance against bludgeoning, piercing, and slashing damage dealt by weapon attacks.

# 4. - *Booming Blade* (M,S) level 0 Evocation [UB]

**[Artificer, Sorcerer, Warlock, Wizard]**

You brandish the weapon used in the spell's casting and make a melee attack with it against one creature within 5 ft distance. On a hit, the target suffers the weapon attack's normal effects and then becomes sheathed in booming energy until the start of your next turn. If the target willingly moves 5 ft or more before then, the target takes 1d8 thunder damage, and the spell ends. At 5th level, the melee attack deals an extra 1d8 thunder damage to the target on a hit, and the damage the target takes for moving increases to 2d8. Both damage rolls increase by 1d8 at 11th and 17th levels.

Any creature in the bonfire's space when you cast the spell must succeed on a Dexterity saving throw or take 1d8 fire damage. A creature must also make the saving throw when it enters the bonfire's space or ends its turn there. The spell's damage increases by an additional die at 5th, 11th and 17th level.

# 7. - Dancing Lights (V,S) level 0 Evocation [Concentration] [SOL]
